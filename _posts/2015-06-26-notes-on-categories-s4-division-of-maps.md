Composition of maps is analogous to multiplication of numbers, and we try to 
find the analog of the division of numbers.

### Inverses versus Reciprocals

That the `reciprocal` for numbers has the corresponding notion for composition 
of maps, `inverse`.

`Definition:` If A -> (f) -> B, an inverse for f is a map B -> (g) -> A satisfying 
both g◦f = 1A and f◦g = 1B.

If f has an inverse, we say f is an isomorphism, or invertible map.

`Uniqueness of inverses:` Any map f has at most one inverse.

### Isomorphisms as divisors

The process of the following maps by a particular isomorphism is itself a 
reversible process.
