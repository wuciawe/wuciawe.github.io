Today is very surprising to me. The more surprising and ironic thing is that the next day 
I find out that I carried a wrong diploma for the alumnus card application, and the bank stuff 
didn't even check that out! How dare they claim that they are much greater on financial safety 
among other banks. The next day when I go to the sub-district office for applying my social 
security card, the stuff checks out that what I bring is my undergraduate diploma, which makes 
me very embarrassed. By the way, when I see the stuffs in the sub-district office, I am shocked that 
I feel like stepping into a place where all the stuffs are from beauty selection.

Besides the alumnus card application, I also went to swim with some phd mates. With the help and courage 
from them, I finished to swim forth and back in the profundal zone for the first time.

After swimming, we went to eat and chat. After the graduation, I've worked in the new place for weeks. 
It really gives me different feels with being a student staying in the lab doing research works all the 
day. Composing research paper is really tough. Sometimes, a luck (all forms of luck) will change your 
research life completely. If you are not so luck, you will have to face the hard time.

In the work, different from researching of course, it seems to value some other thing over purity, 
neatness and wisdom of the algorithm or program itself. I think I need more time to figure out a better 
way.

And I always think my birthday is very easy to remember, as it's the grain rain, which is the 6th of the 24 solar 
terms. But it seems nowadays people are not very familiar with those traditional concepts. I have to say 
the national day is much easier to remember than the grain rain day, though. And after the conversation, when 
I prepare to sleep, I realized that yy's words are full of foreshadowing. Very smart and deep impression. 
But at that moment, I'm dealing with `ssh` section and organizing those sections on seven-year campus life, and 
so that I didn't catch those words well.

It's also the first time that most exits of GH plaza of line 1 are closed. Really late.
