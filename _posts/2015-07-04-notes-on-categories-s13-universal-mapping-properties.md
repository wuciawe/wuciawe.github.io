The category of sets has a special property, roughly because the objects have no structure: If two points 
agree on points, they are the same map. That is, suppose X ->(f)-> Y and X ->(g)-> Y, if fx = gx for every 
point 1 ->(x)-> X, we can conclude that f = g. This special property of the category of sets is not true of 
S[endomap], nor of S[irreflexive].
