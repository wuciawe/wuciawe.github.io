From [Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-10-questions-can-tell-you-the-most-about-a-person){:target='_blank'}, 
following 20 questions are meant to be asked of public figures and would-be or current politicians, 
but they work well with almost anybody.

They have been tested extensively, and if they are all asked and their answers recorded **IN FULL WITH 
ALL ASIDES AND REMARKS ON THE RECORD** (make this stipulation crystal clear to the interviewee ahead 
of time: "Be careful, everything you say is on the record"), results are often quite astonishing.

Be sure to listen carefully and faithfully record all the asides; they are often priceless.

If you are a reporter, you can set the ground rules for the questioning, the answers will reveal a 
trove of fundamental thinking that is very hard to find with the so-called "hardball" questions, and 
for which any good politician is well prepared. Don't be fooled by the ones that sound "easy"; they 
often uncover the most about a personality.

1.  Besides to your God, your family and your country and your constituents (if any), where do your 
loyalties lie?
2.  In as much precise detail as you see fit, how does your mind work?
3.  Have you ever been in love? If so, describe the experience.
4.  If you were an animal, what animal would you be ~ other than human?
5.  Define "generosity".

8.  In deadly peril, name three people you want in your foxhole with you?

11.  What do you think your worst enemy really thinks about you?

18.  Briefly describe your favorite hat.
19.  Who is the best living lawyer that you know?
20.  If you were made to live out the rest of your days as a famous fictional or non-fictional

Some people can sell themselves better than others, but in the end of the day - their actions define 
who they really are, not their words.
