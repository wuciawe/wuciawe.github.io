These days I have some work on gps trajectories. I'd like to view those gps data on the map, so as to check whether some 
assumptions can make sense. After a little bit of searching, I find this work on github: essoduke/jQuery-tinyMap. Based 
on his work, I make a very simple demo which can plot several trajectories on Google Map.
