When I look back to the seven years, I recall a lot of embarrassing moments. And I really have so many chances to 
learn something from those embarrassments and prepare to act better in the next time. But I didn't.

Way back before entering the university, when I decided to learn Spanish instead of earning a drive licence, 
I lost the first opportunity on forgiveness and consideration. More a high school student, and it's supposed 
to grow up and avoid keeping childish. But I didn't.

At that time, I didn't know nothing. Even so, I should take the lesson after the bad actions and reactions. 
But I was still that high school boy, who cared about nothing and did whatever he liked. Frankly speaking, 
at that time, I didn't have experienced much emotional things and could understand those feelings of others, 
because I never had such feelings before. Years later, I started to have such feelings and understand more 
about what was going on.

In the first two years of campus life, I focused on wrong things. It's unwise to pay attention to meaningless 
argues, team buildings and social activities instead of working hard on maths and physics. I still remember the 
reason I did so is try to learn how to work, talk and act with other people. But the fact turns out, it didn't 
work well.

In the next two years, I think I was quite lucky. I got a chance to feel many emotions. I accidentally found 
myself interested on programming. I worked very hard in these two years. And I went through many emotional 
stokes. I seriously realized that my personality had problem. In order to get away from endless thinking on 
nonsense, I worked even harder on programming. What a clown.

There was an episode in the last year of undergraduate life. The change of the administration of the school made 
the future of that time very blurry. If I was aggressive that time, maybe it would lead me to a better place or 
circumstance.

And in the following summer, I decided to gain a driving licence which make me very funny. I refused to 
make it at a low price, but was determined to do it right after its price rose. It should be a good 
period. And I should act better.

In the fifth year, I decided to learn something interesting myself. I spent a lot of time on studying abstraction 
and probability. At mean while, I used that to keep avoiding thinking of nonsense. What a mental midget. And 
it's also a pity that I failed to maintain a relationship with some wield person. To some extent, it could 
be viewed as mutual destruction.

Then in the sixth year, I devoted most of my time to composing researching paper. That was a very dark 
period. The good thing is I had a chance to feel the fun part of life. It lighted me on a new way to 
interpersonal relation. I do feel very happy on that. And in this year, I re-started to watch American 
drama series. I enjoyed it much and some of them gave me insight on what life would be like.

In the last year, I encountered too much on lies and betrayal. I gave one my mercy, one ruined it. Under 
different circumstances, with different people. I view that as the fact that people start to reveal the 
real one of themselves. The ironic part is, after seven years, I still don't get grown up, I keep on being 
reckless and lack of consideration.

Time doesn't just pass by, it teaches me something. I believe it's different weakness on relation 
after seven years and I will soon figure out a way.

What I regret most are I didn't spend time in a proper way, and I just chose to pass most of the lessons 
given by life. Maybe the reason I didn't work very hard before is that I know it was the last chance for 
me to revel. As I am not a student anymore, I have to take more responsibility. There is a life burden 
on my shoulder after then. Will I be a great fighter for life? Maybe the first step is stopping wasting 
time on nonsense.
