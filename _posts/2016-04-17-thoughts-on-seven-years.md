### Recall The Past

When I look back to the seven years, I recall a lot of embarrassing moments. And I really have so many chances to 
learn something from those embarrassments and prepare to act better in the next time. But I didn't.

Way back before entering the university, when I decided to learn Spanish instead of earning a drive licence, 
I lost the first opportunity on forgiveness and consideration. More a high school student, and it's supposed 
to grow up and avoid keeping childish. But I didn't.

At that time, I didn't know nothing. Even so, I should take the lesson after the bad actions and reactions. 
But I was still that high school boy, who cared about nothing and did whatever he liked. Frankly speaking, 
at that time, I didn't have experienced much emotional things and could understand those feelings of others, 
because I never had such feelings before. Years later, I started to have such feelings and understand more 
about what was going on.

In the first two years of campus life, I focused on wrong things. It's unwise to pay attention to meaningless 
argues, team buildings and social activities instead of working hard on maths and physics. I still remember the 
reason I did so is try to learn how to work, talk and act with other people. But the fact turns out, it didn't 
work well.

In the next two years, I think I was quite lucky. I got a chance to feel many emotions. I accidentally found 
myself interested on programming. I worked very hard in these two years. And I went through many emotional 
stokes. I seriously realized that my personality had problem. In order to get away from endless thinking on 
nonsense, I worked even harder on programming. What a clown.

There was an episode in the last year of undergraduate life. The change of the administration of the school made 
the future of that time very blurry. If I was aggressive that time, maybe it would lead me to a better place or 
circumstance.

And in the following summer, I decided to gain a driving licence which make me very funny. I refused to 
make it at a low price, but was determined to do it right after its price rose. It should be a good 
period. And I should act better.

In the fifth year, I decided to learn something interesting myself. I spent a lot of time on studying abstraction 
and probability. At mean while, I used that to keep avoiding thinking of nonsense. What a mental midget. And 
it's also a pity that I failed to maintain a relationship with some wield person. To some extent, it could 
be viewed as mutual destruction.

Then in the sixth year, I devoted most of my time to composing researching paper. That was a very dark 
period. The good thing is I had a chance to feel the fun part of life. It lighted me on a new way to 
interpersonal relation. I do feel very happy on that. And in this year, I re-started to watch American 
drama series. I enjoyed it much and some of them gave me insight on what life would be like.

In the last year, I encountered too much on lies and betrayal. I gave one my mercy, one ruined it, ungratefully and 
with no honour. Under different circumstances, with different people. I view that as the fact that people 
start to reveal the real one of themselves. The ironic part is, after seven years, I still don't get grown up, 
I keep on being reckless and lack of consideration.

Time doesn't just pass by, it teaches me something. I believe it's different weakness on relation 
after seven years and I will soon figure out a way.

What I regret most are I didn't spend time in a proper way, and I just chose to pass most of the lessons 
given by life. Maybe the reason I didn't work very hard before is that I know it was the last chance for 
me to revel. As I am not a student anymore, I have to take more responsibility. There is a life burden 
on my shoulder after then. Will I be a great fighter for life? Maybe the first step is stopping wasting 
time on nonsense.

### A Saying

About six years ago, I saw a saying 'look ahead, youth fades' from some place. At that time, I don't 
understand the meaning of that saying (actually, I just googled this saying, there is nothing related 
to the 'saying'). And so I asked Todd what that sentence means, he explained his understanding.

Six years later, that saying comes to my mind again. Now, I think I begin to understand the meaning of 
that saying. (To clarify, I think everything in the world is meaningless to everyone, until something 
turns out to be meaningful to a specific person. Everyone stays in a specific state, and moves from one 
state to another as time passes by. In different state, one will feel differently on the meaning of 
things. So back to this one, what I really want to say is that I discard the old feeling on that sentence.) 
Maybe in the 30s or 40s, I will feel more about this saying. Now, what I feel strongly is that time is 
always the problem (like some one told me in the interview three years ago). I hope I can have more 
time and I just waste the time I have in real life.

Besides time, there are other things related with youth, I feel they are saying goodbye to me. And most 
of them are unrecoverable. Sometimes, you just feel you are lost. The question is, is it really necessary 
that you need to figure everything out clearly and then you can start to step on. If so, then you just 
stays. Time again, he will tell you things you are confused with.

Everybody knows that it's important to work hard, but I don't know what is right to work hard on. Some 
may say there is no right or wrong on such things, working hard is always good for you. Maybe, to some 
extent, yes, it is. But you know there exists better things to work hard on. Is it really worthy to 
spend time and efforts on something when you don't know what has long term effects on the life that is 
really worthy to work hard on. But how to define the word worthy, especially when you feel most things 
are meaningless. 

You know you need strategy to solve problems, and it remains true for this one as well. And you also 
know you need to solve contradictions in your mind.
