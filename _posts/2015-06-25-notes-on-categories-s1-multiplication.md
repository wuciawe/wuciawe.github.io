Galileo decomposed the motion of a thrown stock in space into two dimensions. The 
multiplication of two dimensions can reconstruct the motion in space. Thus we can 
describe the complicated motion in space with simpler motions.

-- This scheme with three `objects` and two `maps` or `processes` is the right 
picture of multiplication of objects.
